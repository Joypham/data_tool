In 2010, DJ Ian \"Frank\" Dewhirst recalled he put \"Tainted Love\" on when Marc Almond, the duo\'s singer who worked as a cloakroom guy, came to ask if it was Jones\' recording, before asking to tape it. Some time after, Soft Cell began performing the song in their live setlist, choosing it instead of Frankie Valli\'s \"The Night\". Eventually, a Phonogram Records A&R manager Roger Ames opted the band to record the single at a London-based Advision Studios, with producer Mike Thorne. There, Soft Cell\'s version was recorded in a day and a half with Almond\'s first vocal take being used on the record. Thorne commented that he was surprised by the choice as he had not been impressed by the 1976 version on hearing it, but was impressed by the new arrangement and Almond\'s sinister vocal: \"You could smell the coke on that second, Northern Soul version, it was really so over-ramped and so frantic. It was good for the dance floor, but I didn\'t like the record...when Soft Cell performed the song I heard a very novel sound and a very nice voice, so off we went.\"'), '$.wiki_url','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tainted_Love#Soft_Cell_version_(1981)') WHERE id = 'BCD809A6F9B6436FA07DC39EE4F72DF9';
